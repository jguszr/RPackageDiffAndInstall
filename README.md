## R compare and Install packages script

### Summary

This tiny script comes in hand when you need to re-install a lost R user library, or even if you have a enviroment that you want to replicate towards a team. Of course there are far more *professional* approaches to it, but in my case, I just need to set my both systems with the same packages.
